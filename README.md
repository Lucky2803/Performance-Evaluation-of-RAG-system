# Performance-Evaluation-of-RAG-system
Led a research project evaluating the efficacy of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with LLama 7b. Conducted a thorough comparative analysis employing metrics including BERTScore, Natural Language Inference (NLI), BLUE, ROUGE, among others, to assess RAG wrt standalone system.

The investigation unveiled valuable insights into response coherence and contextual relevance, highlighting the strengths and limitations of RAG systems. Notably, achieved a substantial 30% improvement in the NLI metric, signifying a significant advancement in natural language generation capabilities through the integration of RAG. This project contributes to the evolving landscape of sophisticated language models and their applications.

The code will be open sourced after completion of the research.
